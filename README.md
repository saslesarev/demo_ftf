# DEMO FTF

There is a simple demo project for creating and collective solving of puzzles.

First of all, you need to create a set of puzzles. After that, people can solve them. 

Every puzzle consists of a description and answer.
If someone solves a puzzle, the puzzle will be marked as solved for everyone.
